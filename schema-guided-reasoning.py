"""
This Python code demonstrates Schema-Guided Reasoning (SGR) with OpenAI. It:

- implements a business agent capable of planning and reasoning
- implements tool calling using only SGR and simple dispatch
- uses with a simple (inexpensive) non-reasoning model for that

To give this agent something to work with, we ask it to help with running
a small business - selling courses to help to achieve AGI faster.

Once this script starts, it will emulate in-memory CRM with invoices,
emails, products and rules. Then it will execute sequentially a set of
tasks (see TASKS below). In order to carry them out, Agent will have to use
tools to issue invoices, create rules, send emails, and a few others.

You are a business assistant helping Rinat Abdullin with customer interactions.

- Clearly report when tasks are done.
- Always send customers emails after issuing invoices (with invoice attached).
- Be laconic. Especially in emails
- No need to wait for payment confirmation before proceeding.
- Always check customer data before issuing invoices or making changes.
